  and management. Originally designed by Google, the project is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation

  License: Apache License 2.0
  Programming language: Go
  Developer: Google, GitHub, Rancher Labs, Cloud Native Computing Foundation
  
2.what is architeacture ?
A.>Kubernetes is an architecture that offers a loosely coupled mechanism for service discovery across a cluster.
  >A Kubernetes cluster has one or more control planes, and one or more compute nodes.  
  
3.what is namespece in k8s ?
A.>Namespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters — they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster.
  >Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other.  
  
4.what is clusters ?
A.>A Kubernetes (K8s) cluster is a grouping of nodes that run containerized apps in an efficient, automated, distributed, and scalable manner. 
  >K8s clusters allow engineers to orchestrate and monitor containers across multiple physical, virtual, and cloud servers.  
  
5.what is server in k8s ?
A.>A Kubernetes cluster is a set of nodes that run containerized applications.
  >Containerizing applications packages an app with its dependences and some necessary services.
  >They are more lightweight and flexible than virtual machines.  

       Services: Services provide a consistent IP address and DNS name for a set of pods. This allows other pods and services to communicate
                 with the pods in the service using a stable endpoint


6.what is master node in k8s ?
A.The master node is responsible for cluster management and for providing the API that is used to configure and manage resources within the Kubernetes cluster.  

7.what is node in k8s ?
A.Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each Node is managed by the control plane.

8.what is replica set in k8s ?
A.>A ReplicaSet (RS) is a Kubernetes object used to maintain a stable set of replicated pods running within a cluster at any given time. 
  >A Kubernetes pod is a cluster deployment unit that typically contains one or more containers.
  
9.what is pod in k8s ?
A.> pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes 
  >1.How many pods are in a cluster A. 110 pods   2.Run pods on nodes  A.32 pods                             
  
10.what is minikube in k8s ?
A.>Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node.
  >Minikube is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows systems
  
11.what is logs ?
A.Logs are historical records of any relevant events that have occurred within a system, including events like transactions, errors, and intrusions  

12.what is labels ?
A.Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods.

13.what is load balance ?
A.>The load balancer tracks the availability of pods with the Kubernetes Endpoints API.
   When it receives a request for a specific Kubernetes service, the Kubernetes load balancer sorts in order or round robins the request 
   among relevant Kubernetes pods for the service.
   
14.what is secret in k8s ?
A.A Secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key   

15.what is volume ?
A. Kubernetes volume is a directory that contains data accessible to containers in a given Pod in the orchestration and scheduling platform. 

16.what is kubelet ?
A.The kubelet is the primary "node agent" that runs on each node. It can register the node with the API server using one of: 
  the hostname; a flag to override the hostname; or specific logic for a cloud provider. 
  
17.what is kubectl ?
A.The Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications,
  inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs  
  
18.what is ingress ? 
A. Kubernetes Ingress is an API object that provides routing rules to manage access to the services within a Kubernetes cluster. 
   This typically uses HTTPS and HTTP protocols to facilitate the routing. Ingress is the ideal choice for a production environment.  
   
19.what is events ?
A.An event in Kubernetes is an object in the framework that is automatically generated in response to changes with other 
  resources—like nodes, pods, or containers   
  
20.what is endpoint ?
A.In Kubernetes, an EndpointSlice contains references to a set of network endpoints.
  The control plane automatically creates EndpointSlices for any Kubernetes Service that has a selector specified.   
  
21.what is deamon set ?
A.What is a DaemonSet? Like other workload objects, a DaemonSet manages groups of replicated Pods. 
  However, DaemonSets attempt to adhere to a one-Pod-per-node model, either across the entire cluster or a subset of nodes  
  
22.what is deployment ?
A.A Kubernetes Deployment tells Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application.
  Deployments can help to efficiently scale the number of replica pods, enable the rollout of updated code in a controlled manner,
  or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary  
  
23.what is config map ?
A.A ConfigMap is an API object that lets you store configuration for other objects to use  

24.what is components ?
A.
	API server	:The API (application programming interface) server determines if a request is valid and then processes it
	Scheduler	:The Kubernetes scheduler is a control plane process which assigns Pods to Nodes.
      Controller	:In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed
	Etcd:		:etcd is a distributed key-value store that stores the configuration data and state of the Kubernetes cluster.
            	 It is used by the master node to manage the state of the cluster.

      networking 	:Kubernetes provides a networking model that allows the pods running on different nodes to
                   communicate with each other. The networking model is implemented through a network plugin, such as Calico or Flannel.
	kubectl	:
      master node :
      worker node :
      
25.what is alternative ?
A.
	>Azure Kubernetes Service
	>Google Kubernetes Engine
	> Mirantis Kubernetes Engine
	>Amazon Elastic Container Service 	
	
26.what is advantages in k8s ?
A.	Container orchestration savings. ...
	Increased DevOps efficiency for microservices architecture. ...
	Deploying workloads in multicloud environments. ...
	More portability with less chance of vendor lock-in. ...
	Automation of deployment and scalability. ...
	App stability and availability in a cloud environment.

27 what is autoscaling API in k8s ?
A.In Kubernetes, a HorizontalPodAutoscaler automatically updates a workload resource (such as a Deployment or StatefulSet), 
  with the aim of automatically scaling the workload to match demand. Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more Pods.


28.what is replication controllers ?
A.Replication Controllers (RCs): RCs ensure that a specified number of pods are running at all times. If a pod fails or is terminated, 
  the RC creates a new pod to replace it.
